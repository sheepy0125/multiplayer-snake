Logging messages
Only log messages when absolutely necessary
(or when VERBOSE is set to true from the config file)
Don't include punctuation at the end of the message
Avoid using "successfully" or "attempted ___ but failed"
and things like that

Comments
For section comments, use the `### Comment ###` syntax
For other comments, have a space between the `#` and the
text
Use proper grammar in the commments but don't use
punctuation
Only comment when it is going to help the person viewing
the code (don't do like `# This declares function X`)

Functions
Use type hinting (using the new pipe for Union[] is okay)
Use docstrings if the function is "complex"

Other
Follow PEP8 (use the black formatter with line length of 89)
Follow PEP20 (whoops)
Don't reinvent the wheel, if it exists somewhere else then use it
